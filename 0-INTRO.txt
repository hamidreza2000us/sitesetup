#These scripts will setup IDM and FreeIPA as basic tools for infrastructure management
#I tried to automate every step. This way I can keep track of my learning and also make sure of their accuracy.
#This way multiple features such as DNS servers, Forwarders, DHCP, Package manager, Provisioning, User management ,
#Audit and other features are automaticly activated for entire datacenter
#To start you need to setup two systems for Foreman and FreeIPA
#These systems should be based on below (minimum) requirements:
#1-All OS setup should be minimal with exact OS version
#2-Make sure the Installation DVD is mounted to DVD drive
#FreeIPA	CPU:6C	RAM:8G	Disk:20G	OS:RH82
