#These scripts will setup IDM and FreeIPA as basic tools for infrastructure management
#I tried to automate every step. This way I can keep track of my learning and also make sure of their accuracy.
#This way multiple features such as DNS servers, Forwarders, DHCP, Package manager, Provisioning, User management ,
#Audit and other features are automaticly activated for entire datacenter
#To start you need to setup two systems for Foreman and FreeIPA
#These systems should be based on below (minimum) requirements:
#1-All OS setup should be minimal with exact OS version
#2-Make sure the Installation DVD is mounted to DVD drive
#3-Each server has only one interface
#4-These two servers have required network access to each other or are in a same subnet
#IPA/IDM	CPU:6C	RAM:8G	Disk:20G	OS:RH82			InternetAcess:Yes	subnet:subnet01
#Foreman	CPU:6C	RAM:16G	Disk:200G	OS:CentOS7.8	InternetAcess:Yes	subnet:subnet01
#After (or during the) Installation setup IP address on both servers
#You may find command below useful (CAPITALS should be replaced by a value)

#nmcli dev| grep ethernet | grep connecting | awk '{print $2}' | xargs nmcli dev dis
#ip a a IP/24 dev ENS
#ip route add default via GW dev ENS
#echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf
#ping -c1 GW

#if required, setup proxy for Foreman server
#export http_proxy=http://DOMAIN\\USERN\@ME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT > /etc/profile.d/http_proxy.sh
#echo "proxy=http://proxy.example.com:3128" >> /etc/yum.conf
#echo "proxy_username=yum-user" >> /etc/yum.conf
#echo "proxy_password=qwerty" >> /etc/yum.conf

#ssh to Foreman and excute commands below manually:
mkdir ~/sitesetup-pre/
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamidreza2000us/sitesetup/master/01-Startup.sh -o ~/sitesetup-pre/01-Startup.sh
bash ~/sitesetup-pre/01-Startup.sh
